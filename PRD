## 1 · Internal Press Release (Day 1 Draft)

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – Singapore · 15 Jan 2026**

### *ForgeLift* Turns Any 3-Camera Phone Setup Into a Personal Weight-Lifting Coach

AI-powered multi-view video analysis delivers instant form feedback and auto-builds a personalised training plan—no wearables required.

> **Singapore, 15 Jan 2026** – Today ForgeOn announces **ForgeLift**, a mobile app that leverages a simple **three-camera** phone setup to analyse weight-lifting technique with biomechanical accuracy, highlight faults frame-by-frame, and dynamically prescribe a tailored training program. Early beta testers improved their form-consistency score by **23 % in four weeks**.

*Problem, Solution, Quotes & CTA remain unchanged from v0.1.*

## 2 · Customer & Stakeholder FAQ (delta updates only)

| Area          | Key Q & A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User**      | *What hardware do I need?* – Any three iOS/Android phones capable of 720p @ 60 fps placed at ≈120 ° intervals (front-45°, side-90°, rear-45°). Tripod clamps and a \$15 magnetic sync puck are recommended; in-app AR guides help align cameras. |
|               | *Why three cameras?* – Multi-view dramatically reduces occlusion errors (joint-angle MAE drops from 5.2° → 2.1°; bar-path 3-D RMS error < 2 mm).                                                                                                 |
| **Technical** | *How are the feeds synchronised?* – Phones auto-sync via sub-second NTP handshake; visual sync marker (LED flash) provides frame-level alignment with drift < 16 ms.                                                                             |
|               | *Will single-camera mode still work?* – Yes, but flagged “beta” with lower accuracy and no 3-D joint-moment estimates.                                                                                                                           |

## 3 · Detailed Product Requirements (key sections revised)

### 3.3 User Flow (Happy Path, v0.2)

1. **Camera Set-up Wizard** – AR overlay positions three phones; app confirms distance & angle with on-screen prompts.
2. **Record Set** – All phones auto-record, clap sync occurs, user lifts.
3. **Upload & Merge** – Feeds are zipped client-side, uploaded, and temporally aligned in the cloud.
4. **Analysis** (< 12 s p95 for a 15-rep set) – 3-D pose & bar-path reconstruction; form report returned.
5. Feedback, program update, progress dashboard (unchanged).

### 3.4 Functional Requirements (additions)

### 6 · Open Questions (v0.2)

1. Should we ship a low-cost hardware bundle (tripods + LED sync puck) or rely on user-provided gear?
2. Acceptable analysis-time trade-off: is ≤ 12 s sufficient, or do we target ≤ 8 s at higher infra cost?
3. Do we support tablet + 2-phone setup (wider screens) as a variant?
